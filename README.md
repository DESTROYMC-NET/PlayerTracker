# PlayerTracker
![Build with Maven](https://github.com/DESTROYMC-NET/PlayerTracker/workflows/Build%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

A plugin to track first join and last logout times. This is my first attempt at using databases, so shit might hit the fan.
## Features
- Super easy setup. Drop plugin into `plugins` folder. Setup the config and restart your server.
- Imports from current player data. Bukkit tracks this information, but it's a bit weird.
- Use `/ptreload` to reload the plugin.
## Download
